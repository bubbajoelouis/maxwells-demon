## 🛠️ Why This Repository Exists

Since **peer review is an ideological gate**, and I am an **online community of one**, this repository exists to:

- Store the work independently of academic bottlenecks.
- Preserve an **immutable record of the ideas** before they are conveniently "discovered" by institutions years later.
- Ensure the content remains accessible to those who recognize the need for **physics beyond thermodynamics' flawed legacy**.

## 💬 How to Engage (If Anyone Ever Does)

For now, this is not an "open-source" project in the traditional sense. However, if you’ve stumbled upon this and:

- **Have mathematical, physical, or historical insights that can refine the argument,**
- **Are independently developing recursive energy models that challenge classical thermodynamics,**
- **Can offer a serious critique without defaulting to stage #6 of physics rejection ("Loaded Questions"),**

Then feel free to **clone, fork, or start a discussion**.

## 🔥 Final Note

Physics is not about **defending the past**—it is about **uncovering what has always been there** but was previously **unrecognized or actively ignored**. This work **removes the noise, resolves the vagueness, and builds a framework that academia refused to construct.**

**Maxwell’s Demon is dead. Now, let’s make sure it stays that way.**
